# PROJECT #2 OVERVIEW

##Group: Cheetah (Al, Harsh, Ann, Matt L.)

## Project name: Cheetah

### Idea: 

	Provide a repository reference data for introductory full-stack coding concepts across several key languages and libraries

### Prototype/Concept:

	The app will provide links for each language or library. That link will provide a reference sheet for key statements, concepts or commands. From there the user will be able to chose from these and view related usage details and artifacts. The user will have the option of leaving feedback. 
	An “administrator” version will require authentication and allow for creation of new entries, updating existing entries, and deleting of entries. 

## Technology:

	The app will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Node.JS and Mysql and possibly Handlebars and Sequelize. 
    
## New Technology:
	TBD
